# News Article Keyword Prediction Using Machine Learning
Author: Sunny Zhou
## Purpose
In this project, my goal was to have my model predict which of a given set of keywords can be used for a given news article. The purpose is to see how many of the keywords a barebones model  could correctly identify.
## Files
